# Contributing

Every issue is judged against the bar in [`SCOPE.md`](./SCOPE.md). Read it first.

## Where each request goes

| You have | Go to |
| --- | --- |
| A bug in a skill | [Bug issue](https://github.com/Ballganda/BG-skills/issues/new?template=bug.yml) |
| A change to an existing skill | [Idea or feedback issue](https://github.com/Ballganda/BG-skills/issues/new?template=idea.yml) |
| A question, or "how do I...?" | [Discussions: Q&A](https://github.com/Ballganda/BG-skills/discussions/categories/q-a) |
| An idea for a new skill, or a skill to donate | [Discussions: Ideas](https://github.com/Ballganda/BG-skills/discussions/categories/ideas) |
| Support for another harness or issue tracker | [Discussions: Ideas](https://github.com/Ballganda/BG-skills/discussions/categories/ideas), after you read [`.out-of-scope/`](./.out-of-scope) |

Pull requests are open to collaborators only, so describe the fix in an issue instead.

## Issues written with AI

Agents are welcome to help, but you post the issue, so you own it:

- **One problem per issue.** Several findings from one session are several issues, or none.
- **Short.** If it does not fit on one screen, cut it.
- **Repro first.** The steps that show the problem come before any analysis.
- **No pasted specs.** No full proposals, plans, or rewritten `SKILL.md` files. Describe the problem; the fix is ours to design.
- **Not your project's issues.** If your agent files the specs or tickets for your own project here, it has the wrong repo. Run `/bg-setup` in your project.

## Checks

Run `npm run check` before a change is ready. It checks the skills and runs the skill-check, implement and Replies-line tests, and finishes in well under two minutes.

Also run `python scripts/test-decomp.py` when a change touches the decomp skills (`skills/in-progress/decomp-*`) or `scripts/test-decomp.py`. Those tests are not in `npm run check`, so this is the one place the rule is stated.
